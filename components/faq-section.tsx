      question: "What exactly is stored on-chain?",
      answer:
        "Only cryptographic commitments (hashes) and access attestationsâ€”never your PDFs or personal identifiers.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where are my PDFs stored?",
      answer:
        "Encrypted PDFs are stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS or similar). Decryption keys are shared only with your approved recipients.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a crypto wallet?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you'll connect a compatible wallet to control access, sign shares, and create attestations. We guide you step-by-step.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are zero-knowledge proofs in plain English?",
      answer:
        'They let you prove something is true (like "result is within a safe range") without revealing the underlying document or numbers.',
    },
    {
      question: "Is this available in production today?",
      answer:
        "We're launching in phases. The MVP runs on a Polkadot test environment while we iterate with early users and partners.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I revoke access after sharing?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can revoke a link/QR at any time. Recipients will immediately lose the ability to view or verify.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much will it cost?",
      answer: "During the waitlist phase, early access is free. Pricing will be announced with the public release.",
